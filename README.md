## Project Structure

The project is built with Astro, which searches for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is displayed as a route based on its file name.

Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components must be placed in the `src/components/` directory.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |
